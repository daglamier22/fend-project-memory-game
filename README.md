## Instructions

Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to begin playing.

A timer will begin after you flip your first card, your moves will be counted, and you will be given a star score in real time as you make moves.

Click the arrow next to the timer to reshuffle the cards and start a new game.

See if you can beat your _own_ best score!
